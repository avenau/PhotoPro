=======================Week 1 (Wed 16 Sept - Wed 23 Sept)=======================

We formed a group of five and collectively decided on doing the PhotoPro project.
We outlined the key features of the web application and drafted some user stories.
Discussed software stack. Set up communication channels (Teams, Messenger), Jira and Google Drive.

PLANNED
We allocated user stories to everyone to complete during the week. We also had
to trial a software stack for proof of concept.

FINISHED
I completed the user stories for the explorer user (photo features) during the week.

CHALLENGES
I need to do some reconfiguration to my virtual environment and python system set up
in order to trial the software stack.

REFLECTION
The user stories went well for myself and everyone on the team. We were able to make
useful suggestions to each others work.

I need to make sure I install MongoDB and fix my venv so I can be ready for development.

and install MongoDB.

=======================Week 2 (Wed 23 Sept - Wed 30 Sept)=======================

FINISHED
