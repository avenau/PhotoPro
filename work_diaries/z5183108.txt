=======================Week 1 (Wed 16 Sept - Wed 23 Sept)=======================

We formed a group of five and collectively decided on doing the PhotoPro project.
We outlined the key features of the web application and drafted some user stories.
Discussed software stack. Set up communication channels (Teams, Messenger), Jira and Google Drive.

PLANNED
We allocated user stories to everyone to complete during the week. We also had
to trial a software stack for proof of concept.

FINISHED
I completed the user stories for the explorer user (photo features) during the week.

CHALLENGES
I need to do some reconfiguration to my virtual environment and python system set up
in order to trial the software stack.

REFLECTION
The user stories went well for myself and everyone on the team. We were able to make
useful suggestions to each others work.

I need to make sure I install MongoDB and fix my venv so I can be ready for development.

NEXT
Complete storyboard diagram for proposal. Help with background if needed. Fix venv
and install MongoDB.

=======================Week 2 (Wed 23 Sept - Wed 30 Sept)=======================

We focused on completing our allocated tasks for the proposal.

PLANNED
Complete storyboard diagram. Fix up venv and install MongoDB

FINISHED
Almost completed storyboard diagram. Fixed virtualenv, installed MongoDB, watched video on React.

CHALLENGES
Figuring out each component for storyboard.

REFLECTION
It was good being able to collaborate on the storyboard. The process could be more efficient
if we set out certain standards for design decisions earlier on.

NEXT
Finish storyboard. Help with writing assumptions for proposal.
