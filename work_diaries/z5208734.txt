Week 1
Formed a group and decided on doing PhotoPro.
Discussed our options on what development stack to use.

Week 2
I did the 'Achieving Project Objectives' section.
Met with Allan and Joanne to work on the storyboard.
I didn't make it to the extra team meeting this week.
In the first meeting the team talked about potential novelty features.
In the lab we were drafting and starting our proposal, planning to get the draft finished by week 3 first meeting.
Joseph made a quick app using the development stack we agreed on and made a video on what he did.

Week 3
Worked on the storyboard a little bit with Allan and Joanne.
In the first meeting we were discussing about what we did on week 2.
	- Coen did the Background section in the proposal as well as copying all the user stories into JIRA
	- Joseph did the Software Architecture section for the proposal
	- Joanne did a big part of the storyboard
	- Allan estimated the rest of the story points and also did a big part of the storyboard
In the second meeting we planned for our first sprint.
We later decided to use React instead of Angular because Coen and Joanne has some experience in React.
