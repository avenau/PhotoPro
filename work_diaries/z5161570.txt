Week 1
Group formed and decided on PhotoPro for the project.
I created the Jira board.
I wrote stories relating to contributor interactions with photos and make edits/comments to the other stories that have been created.
I discussed with the team our options for a development stack and we decided on Flask, Angular, MongoDB and Python.
For next week we are planning to have user stories completed and ready to be added to Jira.
