# JAJAC PhotoPro Capstone Project

PhotoPro by JAJAC is a revolutionary new platform in the stock photography market.
PhotoPro was built using React, Python, Flask and MongoDB.

# Getting started ðŸš€

## Requirements

Note that the following dependencies should already be installed on VLAB. Please ensure that they are.

- python3
- python3-venv
- python3-pip
- npm

All other dependencies are managed by npm in `frontend/package.json`

## Setting up the project on VLAB

Unzip our software quality submission.

`unzip photopro.zip`

Change into the root directory of our application.

`cd photopro`

Install the requirements of PhotoPro by running the `prepare.sh` script.

`./prepare.sh -l`

**Note: Running `-l` with `prepare.sh` is required to download all the images from our remote file system to VLAB's local file system. This is to reduce latency in our application**

The prepare script only needs to be run once.

It may take 2-3 minutes to install all the dependencies.

## Running the project on VLAB

In the photopro-JAJAC directory, run the start script to start PhotoPro.

`./start.sh -l`

**Note: By running start.sh with the -l flag the user will be interacting with files on the local file system as opposed to a remote server. Note that the database is hosted on an external server, not on the userâ€™s machine.**

If you want to change the showdown duration for testing purposes, you can run this start script command instead.

`./start.sh -s <duration minutes>`

e.g. `./start.sh -s 5` will have new showdowns starting every 5 minutes.

And you're done ðŸ˜Ž. You can start using PhotoPro!
