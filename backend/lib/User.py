User interactions with the database and display on frontend


Viewing photo details
Feed --> has grid of watermarked images with photo ids --> click on it --> search for photo id
    Search for photo id in db --> get photo link, title, tags, contributor, price, array of likes
    array of comments

    *if contributor changes price...?? should keep a history of prices and timelog*
    --> rerender page??


Uploading price, tags,
just create a new photo object
    --> create wrapper to do type checks and restrictions?
