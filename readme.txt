JAJAC PhotoPro Capstone Project
-------------------------------

PhotoPro by JAJAC is a revolutionary new platform in the stock photography market.
PhotoPro was built using React, Python, Flask and MongoDB.

Getting started
---------------
Requirements
------------

Note that the following dependencies should already be installed on VLAB. Please ensure that they are.

- python3
- python3-venv
- python3-pip
- npm

All other dependencies are managed by npm in `frontend/package.json`
and pip in `backend/requirements.txt`

Setting up the project on VLAB
------------------------------

Unzip our software quality submission.

`$ unzip project.zip -d photopro`

Change into the root directory of our application.

`$ cd photopro`

Install the requirements of PhotoPro by running the `prepare.sh` script.

`$ ./prepare.sh -l -r`

Note: Running `-l` with `prepare.sh` is required to download all the images
from our remote file system to VLAB's local file system as all logic is required
to run on VLAB. Running `-r` with `prepare.sh` will reset the remote database
to a pre-saved state, this is to ensure stability between the required local
filesystem and remote database.

The prepare script only needs to be run once.

It will take a few minutes to install all the dependencies.

Running the project on VLAB
---------------------------

In the photopro directory, run the start script to start PhotoPro.

`$ ./start.sh -l`

Note: By running start.sh with the -l flag the user will be interacting with files
on the local file system as opposed to a remote server. Note that the database is
hosted on an external server, not on the userâ€™s machine.

If you want to change the showdown duration for testing purposes, you can run this start script command instead.

`$ ./start.sh -s <duration minutes>`

e.g. `$ ./start.sh -s 5` will have new showdowns starting every 5 minutes.

And you're done. You can start using PhotoPro!
